        During my spare-time I try to enjoy quality time with friends and family.
        One of my favorite things to do so, is by travelling and experiencing new cultures and places.
        Although I'm not by any means measured a professional photographer, I really like documenting and taking photos.

        I have had the opportunity to visit quite a few countries, mostly in Europe, Asia and North America.
